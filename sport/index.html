            To live a healthy life, you must prioritize consistent movement and deep cellular hydration every single day.
            Focus on consuming whole, unprocessed foods that fuel your metabolism, reduce inflammation, and stabilize hormonal levels for peak performance.
            Quality sleep is the foundation of recovery; aim for at least 8 hours of rest in a dark, cool, and technology-free environment.

            Manage daily stress through mindful practices such as breathing, walking, or meditation, as mental balance is just as important as physical strength.
            Build sustainable habits instead of short-term fixes, and listen to your body’s signals to avoid burnout or injury.
            Consistency, patience, and self-discipline are the true drivers of long-term health and vitality.

            Prioritize regular strength and mobility exercises to maintain functional fitness and prevent future injuries.
            Incorporate a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to maximize nutrient intake and support gut health.
            Drink water consistently throughout the day, not just when you feel thirsty, to maintain optimal hydration at the cellular level.

            Take moments of stillness or stretching to reset your nervous system and improve mental clarity.
            Spend time outdoors for natural sunlight exposure, which supports vitamin D production and circadian rhythm regulation.

            Listen to your body and rest when needed; recovery is as essential as training.
            Mix cardio, strength, and flexibility workouts for balanced fitness and long-term endurance.
            Challenge your mind daily through reading, learning, or problem-solving to boost cognitive health.
            Include anti-inflammatory herbs and natural supplements where appropriate to enhance wellness.
            Surround yourself with supportive, like-minded people who inspire healthy habits.
            Set realistic goals and track your progress to stay motivated and accountable.
            Remember that self-compassion is key; celebrate small victories and embrace your journey to holistic health.

Warm-up (10-15 minutes of mobility): Don't jump straight to a loaded barbell. Mobility drills and feeder sets increase the secretion of synovial fluid your joints' natural lubricant, which prevents premature cartilage wear.
Using a lifting belt only for heavy sets: Don't wear your belt throughout the entire workout. Use it only when you hit 80-85% of your maximum capacity. This allows your core stabilizer muscles to work on their own and get stronger during medium-weight sets.
No Ego Lifting: Leave your pride at the gym door. Perfect form with 80 kg stimulates the muscle much more efficiently and safely than a jerky, dangerous rep with 100 kg. Your safety is more important than the number of plates others see you moving."

elif speed == "Landing Technique Land softly: When you stop abruptly or jump, land on the balls of your feet, not your heels. Keep your knees flexed and aligned with your toes. If your knees cave in during a change of direction, you put massive pressure on your ACL anterior cruciate ligament.
Quality over Quantity The Nervous System: Speed should be trained when you are fresh. Do not perform agility drills to the point of total exhaustion, as your form will break down and you will teach your brain to move slowly. Take 1-2 minute breaks between sprints to allow your central nervous system to recover fully.
Low Center of Gravity: To change direction instantly, you must drop your hips. The closer you are to the ground, the more control and stability you have. If you stand too tall, you will lose your balance and be much slower on the turns."

else 
if stamina == "The 80 20 Rule: Do not train at maximum intensity every day. About 80 percent of your endurance training should be at a moderate intensity where you can still hold a short conversation and only 20 percent at high intensity. This builds a solid aerobic base without overtaxing your heart and joints.
Hydration and Electrolytes: Your stamina will drop dramatically if you are dehydrated. Do not just drink plain water. You need salt, magnesium, and potassium so that the electrical signals between your brain and muscles function correctly over long periods. If you start cramping, you are already in a major deficit.
Pacing and Breathing: Learn to control your pace from the very start. If you go out too hard, lactic acid will build up in your muscles and you will hit a wall. Breathe rhythmically and deeply, through your nose as much as possible, to maintain a steady level of oxygen in your blood."
